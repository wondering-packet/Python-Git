# NOTE: even though we are doing multiprocessing, the processing time is actually more than without it.
# reason is: by adding processes, we are adding some overhead which in our case is quite a bit.
# even though our processes themselves are executing in parallel thus reducing execution time individually,
# this still doesn't compensate for the time added by overhead operations.
# the goal should always be so that the execution time overly compensates for the overhead time
# which in turn makes our program faster overall, however this is not the case here.
# why? we are not actually doing CPU-heavy tasks here. thus the time saved on CPU processing is marginal
# & thus not able to compensate for the overhead time.
# multiporcessing would be useful if we were doing CPU-heavy tasks.
